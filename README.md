    "mappings": {
      "properties": {
        "description": {
          "type": "keyword"
        },
        "face_vector": {
          "type": "dense_vector",
          "dims": 128,
          "index": true,
          "similarity": "l2_norm"
        },
        "image_base64": {
          "type": "text"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
